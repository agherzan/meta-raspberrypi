1. Description
==============

This is the general hardware specific BSP overlay for the RaspberryPi device.

More information can be found at:
                   http://www.raspberrypi.org/ (Official Site)

The core BSP part of meta-raspberrypi should work with different
OpenEmbedded/Yocto distributions and layer stacks, such as:
* Distro-less (only with OE-Core).
* Angstrom.
* Yocto/Poky (main focus of testing).

2. Yocto BSP Layer - RaspberryPi
================================

This layer depends on:

URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
branch: master
revision: HEAD

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
layers: meta-oe, meta-multimedia
branch: master
revision: HEAD

How to use it:

1. source poky/oe-init-build-env rpi-build
2. Add needed layer to bblayers.conf:
    - meta-raspberrypi
3  Set MACHINE to "raspberrypi"/"raspberrypi2" in local.conf
4. bitbake rpi-hwup-image
5. dd to a SD card the generated sdimg file (use xzcat if rpi-sdimg.xz is used)
6. Boot your RPI.

2.A. Optional - compressed deployed files:
==========================================
1. Overwrite IMAGE_FSTYPES in local.conf
    IMAGE_FSTYPES = "tar.bz2 ext3.xz"
2. Overwrite SDIMG_ROOTFS_TYPE in local.conf
    SDIMG_ROOTFS_TYPE = "ext3.xz"
3. Overwrite SDIMG_COMPRESSION in local.conf
    SDIMG_COMPRESSION = "xz"
*Accommodate the values above to your own needs (ex: ext3 / ext4).

2.B. Optional - GPU memory:
===========================
Variable    : Details
GPU_MEM     : GPU memory in megabyte. Sets the memory split between the ARM and
              GPU. ARM gets the remaining memory. Min 16. Default 64.
GPU_MEM_256 : GPU memory in megabyte for the 256MB Raspberry Pi. Ignored by the
              512MB RP. Overrides gpu_mem. Max 192. Default not set.
GPU_MEM_512 : GPU memory in megabyte for the 512MB Raspberry Pi. Ignored by the
              256MB RP. Overrides gpu_mem. Max 448. Default not set.

2.C.Optional - Add purchased license codecs:
============================================
To add you own licenses use variables KEY_DECODE_MPG2 and KEY_DECODE_WVC1 in
local.conf. Example:
KEY_DECODE_MPG2 = "12345678"
KEY_DECODE_WVC1 = "12345678"
You can supply more licenses separated by comma. Example:
KEY_DECODE_WVC1 = "0x12345678,0xabcdabcd,0x87654321"

2.D. Optional - Disable overscan:
=================================
By default the GPU adds a black border around the video output to compensate for
TVs which cut off part of the image. To disable this set this variable in
local.conf:
DISABLE_OVERSCAN = "0"

2.E. Optional - Set overclocking options:
=========================================
The Raspberry PI can be overclocked. As of now overclocking up to the "Turbo
Mode" is officially supported by the raspbery and does not void warranty.
Check the config.txt for a detailed description of options and modes. Example:
# Turbo mode
ARM_FREQ = "1000"
CORE_FREQ = "500"
SDRAM_FREQ = "500"
OVER_VOLTAGE = "6"

2.F. Optional - Video camera support with V4L2 drivers
======================================================
Set this variable to enable support for the video camera (Linux 3.12.4+ required)
VIDEO_CAMERA = "1"

2.G. Optional - Enable offline compositing support
==================================================

Set this variable to enable support for dispmanx offline compositing
DISMANX_OFFLINE = "1"

This will enable the firmware to fall back to off-line compositing of
Dispmanx elements. Normally the compositing is done on-line, during scanout,
but cannot handle too many elements. With off-line enabled, an off-screen
buffer is allocated for compositing. When scene complexity (number and sizes
of elements) is high, compositing will happen off-line into the buffer.

Heavily recommended for Wayland/Weston.

See: http://wayland.freedesktop.org/raspberrypi.html

2.H. Images
===========
* rpi-hwup-image
    Hardware up image
* rpi-basic-image
    Based on rpi-hwup-image with some added features (ex: splash)
* rpi-test-image
    Image based on rpi-basic-image which includes most of the packages in this
    layer and some media samples.

2.I. Boot to U-Boot
===================
To have u-boot load kernel image, set in your local.conf
KERNEL_IMAGETYPE = "uImage"

This will make kernel.img be u-boot image which will load uImage.
By default, kernel.img is the actual kernel image (ex. Image).

2.J. Image with Initramfs
=========================
To build an initramfs image :
    * Set this 3 kernel variables (in linux-raspberrypi.inc for example)
        - kernel_configure_variable BLK_DEV_INITRD y
        - kernel_configure_variable INITRAMFS_SOURCE ""
        - kernel_configure_variable RD_GZIP y
    * Set the yocto variables (in linux-raspberrypi.inc for example)
        - INITRAMFS_IMAGE = "<a name for your initramfs image>"
        - INITRAMFS_IMAGE_BUNDLE = "1"
    * Set the meta-rasberrypi variable (in raspberrypi.conf for example)
        - KERNEL_INITRAMFS = "-initramfs"

2.K. Device tree support
=========================
Device tree for RPi is only supported when using linux-raspberrypi 3.18+
kernels.

    * Set KERNEL_DEVICETREE (in conf/machine/raspberrypi.conf)
        - the trailer is added to the kernel image before kernel install task.
          While creating the SDCard image, this modified kernel is put on
          boot partition (as kernel.img) as well as DeviceTree blobs (.dtb files).

NOTE: KERNEL_DEVICETREE is default enabled for kernel >= 3.18 and always disabled for
      older kernel versions.

3. Extra apps
=============

3.A. omxplayer
==============
omxplayer depends on libav which has a commercial license. So in order to be
able to compile omxplayer you will need to whiteflag the commercial license
adding to you local.conf:
LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial"


4. Source code and mirrors
==========================

Main repo:
    git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
    http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/meta-raspberrypi

5. Contributing
===============

5.A. Mailing list
=================
The main communication tool we use is a mailing list:
    yocto@yoctoproject.org
    https://lists.yoctoproject.org/listinfo/yocto

Feel free to ask any kind of questions but always prepend your email subject
with "[meta-raspberrypi]". This is because we use the 'yocto' mailing list and
not a perticular 'meta-raspberrypi' mailing list.

To contribute to this layer you should send the patches for review to the
above specified mailing list.
The patches should be compliant with the openembedded patch guidelines:
http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Commit_Patch_Message_Guidelines

To send changes to mailing list use something like:
    git send-email --to yocto@yoctoproject.org \
    --subject-prefix='meta-raspberrypi][PATCH'

5.B. Redmine
============
In order to manage and trace the meta-raspberrypi issues, we use redmine:
    http://redmine.gherzan.ro/projects/meta-raspberrypi

Here we report, trace and develop bugs, features or support tickets for this
yocto BSP later.

If you push patches which have a redmine issue associated, please provide the
issue number in the commit log just before "Signed-off-by" line(s). Example line
for a bug:
    [Bug #13]
