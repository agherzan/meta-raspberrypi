How to Report a Potential Vulnerability?
========================================

If you would like to report a public issue (for example, one with a released
CVE number), please report it via GitHub issues:

  https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi/issues/new/choose

If you are dealing with a not-yet released or urgent issue, please send a
message to one of the maintainers listed in the [README.md](https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi/blob/master/README.md).  Include as many
details as possible:
  - the layer or software module affected
  - the recipe and its version
  - any example code, if available
